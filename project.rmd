## Toy dataset for our R project

**Our hypothesis**

Entropy should be higher in colloquial speech than in scientific texts and this difference should be the most noticable in three linguistic parameters:

1) Most frequent colloquial phrases like "you know"
2) Elliptical structures
3) Contracted forms

**Data**

Scientific articles about COVID-19 + Tweets

The first dataset "Scientific articles about COVID-19" is taken from https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. This a collection of parsed scientific articles

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here is a sample from our data set of scientific articles with respect to one linguistic parameter -- contractions. We counted how many contractions occured in texts.

```{r}
toy_data <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tatiana-iazykova/project_R/main/toy_dataset_science.csv)

summary(toy_data)
```
